      HacSwitchAlarmEventMessage is defined by legacy HAC. It has a field named timestamp,
      and it inherits a field named timeStamp (note the capital 'S'). Findbugs complains
      about this, and rightfully so. However, to ensure interoperability, we are not
      changing its structure or field names. So, we'll have to live with this for now.
